A MAC implies such a (two-round) protocol.",

abstract="One interesting and important challenge for the cryptologic community is that of providing secure authentication and identification for unassisted humans. There are a range of protocols for secure identification which require various forms of trusted hardware or software, aimed at protecting privacy and financial assets. But how do we verify our identity, securely, when we don't have or don't trust our smart card, palmtop, or laptop?",

abstract="Modern cryptography has had considerable impact on the development of computational learning theory. Virtually every intractability result in Valiant's model [13] (which is representation-independent in the sense that it does not rely on an artificial syntactic restriction on the learning algorithm's hypotheses) has at its heart a cryptographic construction [4, 9, 1, 10]. In this paper, we give results in the reverse direction by showing how to construct several cryptographic primitives based on certain assumptions on the difficulty of learning. In doing so, we develop further a line of thought introduced by Impagliazzo and Levin [6].",

abstract="While most lightweight authentication protocols have been well analyzed with respect to their security, often only little (or even nothing) is known with respect to their suitability for low-cost RFIDs in the range of {\$}0.05 to {\$}0.10. Probably this is mainly due to the fact that open literature rarely provides information on what conditions need to be met by a scheme in practice, hindering a sound development and analysis of schemes.",

However, despite the very simple on-tag computation there remain some practical problems with                                                                  and despite an elegant proof of security against some limited active attacks, there is a simple man-in-the-middle attack due to Gilbert et al. [8]. In this paper we consider improvements to                                                                  in terms of both security and practicality.

We then describe an enhanced variant called                                                                  which offers practical advantages over                                                                 .",
