A MAC implies such a (two-round) protocol.",

abstract="One interesting and important challenge for the cryptologic community is that of providing secure authentication and identification for unassisted humans. There are a range of protocols for secure identification which require various forms of trusted hardware or software, aimed at protecting privacy and financial assets. But how do we verify our identity, securely, when we don't have or don't trust our smart card, palmtop, or laptop?",

abstract="Modern cryptography has had considerable impact on the development of computational learning theory. Virtually every intractability result in Valiant's model [13] (which is representation-independent in the sense that it does not rely on an artificial syntactic restriction on the learning algorithm's hypotheses) has at its heart a cryptographic construction [4, 9, 1, 10]. In this paper, we give results in the reverse direction by showing how to construct several cryptographic primitives based on certain assumptions on the difficulty of learning. In doing so, we develop further a line of thought introduced by Impagliazzo and Levin [6].",
